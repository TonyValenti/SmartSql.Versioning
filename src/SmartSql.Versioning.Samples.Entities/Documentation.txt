With this code, I have generalized our versioning operations and procedures.

These are the common operations:
Add         -   Adds a new Item
Update      -   Updates an existing item
Get         -   Gets a single item
List        -   Gets a list of items
Archive     -   Marks an item as deleted
Restore     -   Un-marks an item as deleted.
History     -   Gets the change history for an item

See the "Testing.ps1" file for examples.
